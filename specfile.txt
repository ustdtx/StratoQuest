Strato Quest – Final Specfile (LLM-Ready, Tutorial Style)
1. Technical Constraints

Allowed OpenGL / GL Functions
GL_Depth()
glColor3f

glMatrixMode

glPushMatrix / glPopMatrix

glutSwapBuffers

glLoadIdentity

glTranslatef

glRotatef

glScalef

glBegin / glEnd

glVertex3f

glRasterPos2f

glPointSize

glClear

glViewport

Allowed GLUT Functions

glutInit, glutInitDisplayMode, glutInitWindowSize, glutInitWindowPosition

glutCreateWindow, glutMainLoop

Callbacks: glutDisplayFunc, glutKeyboardFunc, glutSpecialFunc, glutMouseFunc, glutIdleFunc

Drawing: glutSolidCube, glutBitmapCharacter

Allowed GLU Functions

gluPerspective, gluLookAt, gluOrtho2D, gluNewQuadric, gluCylinder, gluSphere

No other GL/GLUT/GLU functions are permitted.

2. Game States

MENU → Start Game

LEVEL_SELECT → Choose Level (All levels unlocked)

PLAYING → Gameplay

GAME_OVER → Player HP = 0, shows Retry

Implementation: single state variable with switch logic.

3. Camera & Perspective

Third-person, behind-the-jet view

Jet moves in X/Y plane; Z fixed

World moves toward player (-Z)

Use gluLookAt to position camera behind jet

4. Player

Movement: WASD, bounded box
Firing:

Left click → Normal bullets

Right click → Missile special (6 homing missiles)

Implementation:

Player stored as player_x, player_y, player_z

Rendered using glPushMatrix → glTranslatef → draw_player_jet() → glPopMatrix

5. Player Jet Model

Built from primitives: cubes, triangles

Hierarchical rendering using glPushMatrix / glPopMatrix

6. Weapons

Normal Gun:

Bullet = quad

Moves straight along -Z

Collision with enemies reduces HP

Missiles:

Homing toward nearest enemies

Track enemy position per frame

Destroyed on impact

Laser:

Temporary (10s) replacement for normal gun

Long quad along -Z

7. UI Elements (3D / 2D)

HP Bar: Top-left 2D bar via gluOrtho2D

Shield Indicator: Transparent halo (sphere) around jet

Missile Cooldown: 3D pie chart using gluDisk or segmented quads

Crosshair: 3D "+" in front of jet

8. Enemies

Types:

Standard: 3 HP, 10 dmg, forward + player tracking

Fast: 1 HP, 5 dmg, zigzag + tracking

Heavy: 7 HP, 30 dmg, slow, delayed attack

Behavior:

Track player via: dx = player_x - enemy.x, dy = player_y - enemy.y

Update position each frame: enemy.x += dx*speed, enemy.y += dy*speed

Rendering: Use glPushMatrix, glTranslatef, glRotatef, then draw primitive(s), glPopMatrix.

9. Enemy Waves

Semi-procedural: number/type of enemies fixed per level

Random spawn positions within level bounds

Wave duration ~2.5 mins; finish early if all enemies destroyed

10. Collisions

Player vs Enemy: enemy destroyed, player takes 5 dmg

Bullet vs Enemy: apply damage, destroy enemy if HP ≤ 0

Pickup/Ring: collectable objects, grant bonus points

11. Pickups

Health: +20 HP

Shield: activates one-hit protection

Laser: temporary weapon upgrade

All enclosed in transparent spheres

Rotating for visibility

12. Rings

Bonus points

Torus-like primitive using gluCylinder segments or vertex rings

Collision detection when player passes through

13. Levels & Visual Identity

Total 5 levels

Each visually distinct: background colors + objects

Level Themes:

Blue sky + sun

Sunset sky

Blue sky + clouds

Purple sunset + clouds

Red sky (final level, boss)

Objects: sun, clouds, rocks; rendered with gluSphere, gluCylinder, glutSolidCube

14. Final Boss (Level 5)

Amalgamation of all enemy types

Multiple attack patterns, phases triggered by HP

Fully scripted, no procedural logic

15. Cheat Mode

Enabled before starting level

Player HP does not decrease

Damage logic bypassed if active

16. Game Over

Triggered when HP ≤ 0

Shows “Game Over”

Retry button → return to Level Select

17. Timing & Level Length

Each level ~3 minutes

Enemy waves ~2.5 minutes

Level can end earlier if all enemies killed

esc button will pause game there will be a quit to level select button pressing esc again will continue

18. Rendering Guidelines

All objects: glPushMatrix() → transforms → draw → glPopMatrix()

Use only allowed GL/GLUT/GLU functions

No shaders, textures, or lighting
